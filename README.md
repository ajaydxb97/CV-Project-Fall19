# CV-Project-Fall19
Object Recognition of 8 ball and Black Yo-yo

This is the project for the course CS/RBE 549 Computer Vision, Fall 2019 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
In this project we aim to locate and recognize an 8-ball and a black yo-yo in a given image.

For the HOG, please change the path to the folder and run the program step by step to get the results. Or just load the trained linear SVM to predict the results. 

We use several techniques for accomplishing this task.
